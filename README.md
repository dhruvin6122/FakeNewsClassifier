# 📰 Fake News Detection System

A machine learning-based web application that classifies news articles as **Real** or **Fake** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **TF-IDF vectorization**, and a **Naive Bayes classifier**. The system is built with a clean and responsive **Flask web interface**, making it easy to test and demonstrate.
